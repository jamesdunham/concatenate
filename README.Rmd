Functions in concatenate construct human-friendly text from elements whose
values aren't known in advance, as in calls to `message`, `warning` or `stop`.

## Basics

```{r, knitr-options, echo = FALSE}
# rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-",
  cache = FALSE)
library(concatenate)
```

Each function in concatenate returns a comma-separated string. (A length-one
character vector.) The workhorse function in concatenate is `cc`.
```{r}
cc("one fish", "two fish")
```

Its wrappers `cc_or` and `cc_and` insert "or" and "and" between the last two
elements of the input. This is cleaner than wrestling with `paste`.
```{r}
cc_and("this", "that", "the other")
cc_or("one way", "another")
```

`cn` and its derivatives combine these functions with `sprintf`-like
substitution and the grammatical number awareness of `ngettext`.

Like `ngettext`, the `cn` functions return different strings depending on the
number of the object, and two substitutions are made `sprintf`-style:

  * "`%c`": the comma-concatenated values of the object, as in `cc`
  * "`%n`": the number of the object

This encourages verbose user-facing messages from clean code.

```{r}
x <- unique(iris$Species)
cn_and(x, "a single species: %c", "%n unique species: %c")
```

There are row-wise `data.frame` methods for the `cn` functions.
```{r}
singular <- "%n row: %c"
plural <- "%n rows whose values are %c"
cn(chickwts[1, ], singular, plural)
cn_and(chickwts[1:3, 1, drop = FALSE], singular, plural)
```

The `cc` functions are also available as binary infix operators.
```{r}
x <- "important value"
x %c% "!"
```
