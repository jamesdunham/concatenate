Each of the R functions in `concatenate` takes one or more character vectors and
returns a comma-separated string. (A length-one character vector.) They're for
not repeating yourself when producing human-friendly messages whose elements
aren't known in advance.

```{r, knitr-options, echo = FALSE}
# rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-",
  cache = FALSE)
library(concatenate)
```

`cc_and(...)` is like `paste(x, sep = ",")` but it inserts "and" between the last two
elements.
```{r}
cc_and("this", "that", "the other")
```

`cc_or(...)` works the same way.
```{r}
cc_or("one way", "another")
```

`%+%` is for pasting a bit of readable text without typing `paste`.
```{r}
x <- "important value"
x %+% "!"
```
